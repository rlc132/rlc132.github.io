  <!-- add navigation for steps -->
<p class ="intro">What's a Medianoche? A <i><b>medianoche</b></i> (Spanish for "middle of the night") is the kind of sandwich you eat after hours of partying in Miami's Cuban dance clubs. With roast pork, ham, Swiss cheese, and pickles, it's almost identical to a Cuban sandwich, save for the bread, a sweet egg loaf that's similar to challah. The extra richness settles the stomach just a bit more, and it develops a wonderful crust when you toast it.</p>
